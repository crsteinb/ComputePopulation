For the problem proposed, I chose to create the solution in Unity to allow myself the ability to create a dynamic data set generation system and build up a graph system. I felt that since SciGames is actively using Unity in your projects, this was appropriate. 

The project can be opened in Unity 5.3 and the only scene file is the MaxPopulationScene.unity file located at the root of the Assets folder. I have provided a screenshot of the application running at the root of the git repository as a sibling file to this one. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at crsteinb@gmail.com
